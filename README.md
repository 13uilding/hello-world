# hello-world
Baby's first steps down the hallowed ground of nerdom. My brother traverse the path years ago, and I got glimpses of the path. Unfortunately I failed to follow in his steps until recently. I want to make programs that fix problems. I want to apply the knowledge I have acquired through hours of study in my degree of Physics. I want to be a GOD!
